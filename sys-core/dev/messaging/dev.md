## Messaging


Is basically a GRPC based messaging system designed with the extra stuff you need.

https://github.com/uw-labs/substrate/tree/master/natsstreaming

https://github.com/uw-labs/substrate-tools/blob/master/examples/async/async/main.go

Its wraps messaging with grpc.

Might be perfect for us.

ION is tool complex IMHO and relies on stuff we dont want ( redis, etc )

substrate is designed the right way. For example perfect orderings
100% golang, etc
